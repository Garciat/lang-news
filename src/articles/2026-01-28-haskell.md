The Haskell Foundation is pleased to share our progress update for January 2026.

## Key Achievements

### Infrastructure Improvements

We've made significant investments in improving the Haskell tooling infrastructure:

- **GHC CI**: Reduced average build times by 40% through infrastructure upgrades
- **Hackage**: Improved reliability and performance of package uploads
- **Hoogle**: Enhanced search capabilities with better type-based search

### Community Growth

The Haskell community continues to grow:

- Over 500 new packages published to Hackage this month
- 15 successful virtual meetups across different time zones
- Launch of the Haskell Mentorship Program with 100+ participants

### Education Initiatives

We're committed to making Haskell more accessible:

- New "Haskell for Beginners" course launched with 1,000+ enrollments
- Updated documentation for popular libraries
- Video tutorial series covering intermediate topics

## Looking Ahead

Next month we'll be focusing on:

- Expanding the mentorship program
- Organizing HaskellX 2026
- Continuing infrastructure improvements
